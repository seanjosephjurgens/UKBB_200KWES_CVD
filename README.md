Jurgens, Choi, Morrill et al (2021). _Rare Genetic Variation Underlying Cardiometabolic Diseases and Traits: Results from 200,000 Individuals in the UK Biobank_

In particular, adaptations of and wrappers around GENESIS are included in this repository that are optimized for large-scale sequencing analyses of databases with case-control imbalance.

To use any of our functions, one only needs to source the 'GENESIS_adaptation_source.R' script, as all functions are included there. A list of dependencies is provided in that script as well.
