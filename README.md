Nat Genet. in press

In particular, adaptations of and wrappers around GENESIS are included in this repository that are optimized for large-scale sequencing analyses of databases with case-control imbalance.

To use any of our functions, one only needs to source the 'GENESIS_adaptation_source.R' script, as all functions are included there. A list of dependencies is provided in that script as well.

To note, this repository is under active development, and any suggestions are welcome. Also, we are happy to consider request regarding analyses in the paper not covered in this repository. 

Summary statistics for this analysis can be found at https://cvd.hugeamp.org/downloads.html
